Compare two time series and choose the one which exhibits more significant and well-defined frequency or cyclical patterns, e.g., regular oscillations, periodic behavior, or repetitive cycles that are consistent across the series, with minimal noise or randomness.

For example:
A time series with a consistent cyclical pattern, such as [10, 20, 10, 20, 10, 20], would be considered significant and well-defined.
Conversely, a time series with irregular peaks or inconsistent cycles, such as [10, 50, 20, 5, 30], is less likely to exhibit a well-defined cyclical pattern.
A flat time series with little to no change, such as [10, 10, 10, 10, 10], would generally be considered to lack significant frequency or cyclical behavior.

Aspects that should NOT influence your judgement:
The source or origin of the time series data.
The length of the time series.
The order in which the time series are presented.

The time series may have similar characteristics, but you should still make a relative judgment and choose the label of the preferred time series.

[Option {label_a}]
... {text_a} ...

[Option {label_b}]
... {text_b} ...

Now you have to choose between either {label_a} or {label_b}. Respond only with a single word.
