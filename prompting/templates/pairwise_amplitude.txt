Compare two time series and choose the one which exhibits more significant and well-defined amplitude, e.g., consistent and large variations in the range of values across the series, reflecting strong oscillations or signal intensity with minimal noise or randomness.

For example:
A time series with a large and consistent amplitude, such as [0, 10, -10, 10, -10, 10], would be considered significant and well-defined.
Conversely, a time series with small or inconsistent amplitude, such as [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2], is less likely to exhibit well-defined amplitude behavior.
A flat time series with minimal changes, such as [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], would generally be considered to lack significant amplitude.

Aspects that should NOT influence your judgement:
The source or origin of the time series data.
The length of the time series.
The order in which the time series are presented.

The time series may have similar characteristics, but you should still make a relative judgment and choose the label of the preferred time series.

[Option {label_a}]
... {text_a} ...

[Option {label_b}]
... {text_b} ...

Now you have to choose between either {label_a} or {label_b}. Respond only with a single word.
